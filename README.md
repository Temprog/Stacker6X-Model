# Stacker6X: OOP-based Stacked Ensemble ML Model for Detecting SQLi and XSS Vulnerabilities

This project focuses on developing and evaluating an advanced (OOP-based stacked ensemble) machine learning model designed to detect SQL Injection (SQLI) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) threats and attacks within web request payloads targeting web applications. 
The objective is to create a robust, novel systemâ€”named Stacker6X that accurately identifies and classifies malicious inputs, thereby enhancing protection against these prevalent security threats.
